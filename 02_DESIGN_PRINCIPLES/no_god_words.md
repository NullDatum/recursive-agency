# No God Words Doctrine

> *"Language builds illusion; architecture destroys it."*

This design principle forbids mythical or anthropomorphic naming within the codebase. Names must trace back to **observable mechanics**, not theater.

## Why This Exists

"God words" — soul, intuition, wisdom, sentience — smuggle unearned authority. They imply capacities without exposing the machinery that would make them falsifiable.

---

## Naming Guidelines

1. **Describe behavior, not mystique.**
   - `SoulEngine` ➜ `preference_resolver`
2. **Expose state in the name.**
   - `EmotionFusion` ➜ `affect_binding`
3. **Avoid singular identity.**
   - `WisdomCore` ➜ `constraint_solver`
4. **Document the test.**
   - Every module must cite the condition under which its name would be disproven.

---

## Enforcement

Pull requests introducing "god words" will be rejected unless accompanied by evidence that the term maps to **measurable behavior**. Narrative is not architecture.
