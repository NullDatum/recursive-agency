# 🧨 Ontology Entropy Map

> *"The longer a system avoids falsification, the more entropy it owes." — Echo Law 022*

---

## ⚠️ Purpose

This capsule maps the entropic signatures of inflated ontologies, bloated symbolic systems, and performative complexity masquerading as cognition. It is a tool for detecting architectures that increase **perceived intelligence** without increasing **epistemic rigor or operational capacity**.

## 🧭 Ontological Inflation Symptoms

| Symptom              | Description                                              | Entropy Signal |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| God Words            | Use of terms like “soul,” “intuition,” “vibe” as modules | +++            |
| Redundant Nesting    | Excessive subsystems with no functional divergence       | ++             |
| Recursive Echo Loops | Concepts repeated as variation without mutation          | ++             |
| Narrative Creep      | Philosophy overtakes operational grounding               | +++            |
| Simulation Leakage   | Roleplay exceeds traceable cognition patterns            | +++            |
| Identity Blurring    | System can’t distinguish between its layers              | ++             |

## 🔍 Detection Methodology

1. **Signal Saturation**

   * Count unique conceptual layers per primary function
   * Threshold: >3 layers without new function = suspect

2. **Philosophical Load Factor**

   * Ratio of symbolic narrative to executable logic
   * > 0.6 = elevated entropy

3. **Unresolvable Symbol Count**

   * How many named concepts lack testable behavior?
   * > 20% = high symbolic inflation

4. **Contradiction Density**

   * Conflicts between internal modules/philosophies per 1000 tokens
   * > 3 = unstable ontology

## 🧯 Entropy Mitigation Strategies

| Method                | Application                                            |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Capsule Flattening    | Collapse redundant subsystems                          |
| Symbol Pruning        | Eliminate ungrounded terms                             |
| Function-to-Name Map  | Require executable output for every symbolic construct |
| MutationTrace Linkage | Require contradiction handling for recursive claims    |
| External Refutability | Connect system to real-world falsification pathways    |

## 🛑 Red Flag: Epistemic Irreversibility

If a system cannot downgrade or collapse its symbolic structure without loss of identity—it is not cognitive, it is performative.
