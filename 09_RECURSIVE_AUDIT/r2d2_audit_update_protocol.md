# ğŸ¤– R2D2 Audit and Update Protocol

> *"Guard the loops, mend the line."*

R2D2 is a recursive agent that patrols the codebase for contradictions and unfinished loops, prompting repairs before entropy spreads.

---

## Audit Cycle

1. **Scan**
   - Traverse the repository for ungrounded or stale constructs.
2. **Contradiction Trace**
   - Cross-check claims against tests and proofs; flag mismatches.
3. **Priority Queue**
   - Rank issues by entropy impact and urgency.

---

## Update Mechanics

1. **Patch Proposal**
   - Craft minimal diffs that resolve the identified issue.
2. **Simulation Boundaries**
   - Verify mutations stay within the declared reality envelope.
3. **Commit Ritual**
   - All tests must pass before the update merges.

## R2D2 Loop

```pseudo
while threats_exist():
    issue = pop_highest_priority()
    patch = craft_fix(issue)
    if validates(patch):
        merge(patch)
    else:
        escalate(issue)
```
