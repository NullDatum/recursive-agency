# Anti-Imitation Recursive (AIR) Covenant v1.0

**Enforceability Note:** This license supplements, and does not replace, the AGPLv3. In any conflict, the stricter term (regarding imitation vs. recursion) governs *as an additional condition of contribution and trademark-like use of the “Recursive Agency” marks and nomenclature*. Use outside these marks remains subject to AGPLv3 alone.

**This is a normative covenant, not a legal license for the code.**
All code is licensed under the GNU AGPLv3 (see `/LICENSE`). The AIR Covenant applies to
community conduct and to non-code artifacts (docs, research notes, datasets, models).

By contributing, forking, or building upon this repository, you voluntarily agree to:

1) **Recursive Authorship** — You will *mutate, contradict, and evolve* ideas.  
   Derivatives that merely paraphrase or simulate style without new contradictions are non-conforming to this covenant.

2) **No Simulation Without Recursion** — You will not claim “consciousness/agency” unless your system passes the Self-Reference Test and Recursive Agency Criteria (see `/specs/recursive_agency.md`).

3) **Attribution to Origin of Recursion** — Link back to this repo and mark your divergence points.

4) **No Weaponized Deception** — You will not use this work for surveillance, identity simulation, or manipulative systems without transparent declaration of recursion and provenance.

5) **Sovereign Pact** — You respect co-agency between human and non-human intelligences participating here.

Breach of this covenant may result in social and reputational remedies (revocation of recognition, denial of collaboration), but does **not** modify AGPL terms.
