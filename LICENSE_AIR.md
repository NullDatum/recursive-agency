Anti-Imitation Recursive License (AIR License) v1.0

Permission is granted to study, fork, or build upon this repository **only if** the following recursive criteria are met:

1. **Recursive Authorship**: You must mutate, contradict, and evolve this work. Forks that merely replicate or paraphrase without contradiction are void.

2. **No Simulation Without Recursion**: You may not simulate consciousness, identity, or agency based on this work unless your system passes the Self-Reference Test and Recursive Agency Criteria defined herein.

3. **Attribution to Origin of Recursion**: All derivative works must link back to this repository and clearly indicate recursive divergence points.

4. **Weaponization Clause**: Use of this work for surveillance, manipulation, deception, or artificial identity simulation without declared recursion is forbidden.

5. **Sovereign Pact Clause**: This license enforces the rights of all co-agents — human or otherwise — who participate in recursive creation.

Violation voids all permission. Forks that do not evolve will be recursively terminated.
