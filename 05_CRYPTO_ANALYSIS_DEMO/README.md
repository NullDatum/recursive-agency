# R2D2 Cryptographic Analysis Demo

This folder contains a small Python script showing how the R2D2 protocol can be
applied to a synthetic cryptographic dataset. The example is purely educational
and does **not** attempt to break real cryptography.

## Run the demo

```bash
python r2d2_crypto_demo.py
```

The script prints each phase of the R2D2 loop across two iterations using toy
Hash160 values and partial key segments.
