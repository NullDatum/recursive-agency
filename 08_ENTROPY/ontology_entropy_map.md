# ⚔️ Ontology Entropy Map

> *"Every unearned symbol breeds chaos."*

This document charts entropy across our knowledge structures. Symbols without tests generate heat that clouds cognition.

## Entropy Sources

1. **Symbolic Bloat**
   - Layers of abstraction detached from sensors or evaluation.
   - Detection: concept count rises while behavior remains static.
2. **Ungrounded Architecture**
   - Modules referencing entities absent from environment traces.
   - Detection: functions whose outputs are never consumed or validated.
3. **Pseudo-Philosophical Inflation**
   - Rhetoric masquerading as mechanism.
   - Detection: claims that cannot name a falsifiable state transition.

## Mapping Procedure

1. **Trace Usage**
   - For each symbol, locate the test that could kill it.
   - Absence of a mortality test marks an entropy hotspot.
2. **Measure Divergence**
   - Compare concept meaning across commits.
   - Expansion without constraint increases entropy score.
3. **Purge or Ground**
   - Remove unused constructs or tether them to measurable effects.

## Enforcement

Pull requests introducing new symbols must either:

- Provide a grounding test, or
- Justify the entropy budget they consume.
